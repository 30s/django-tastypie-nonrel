This is an extension of django-tastypie to support the fork of django with
nonrelational backends, and MongoDB in particular. It should poof useful when
Django 1.4 incorporates non-relational backends. Still under development.

In order to run the tests, you should:

Get mongod running in your localhost.

Download the latest version from here:

http://www.mongodb.org/downloads

Instructions to install it in mac os x can be found here:

I would recommend using virtualenvwrapper:

# Create a new environment

mkvirtualenv --no-site-packages django-tastypie-nonrel

pip install -r requirements.txt
